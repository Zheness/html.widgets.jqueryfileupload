How to use Simple File Uploader

This object provides a simple use of File Upload with few lines of code.
When you upload a file, it is saved in temp folder. After the form save you could retrieve all file send and move it in your folder

Step 1: create instance

![File Upload create instance name](https://raw.github.com/thecodingmachine/html.widgets.fileuploaderwidget/2.0/doc/images/create_instance_name.png)

Next, set the parameters :
 - input name: It's like the name of your input element in a form;
 - directory: to store your file;
 - session: sessionManagerInterface to start the session automatically.


Others parameters are mandatory. The most important:
 - OnlyOneFile: If you want to send only 1 file (many by default). This delete the file contain in the destination folder to store only one. Note: it's not a graphic parameter;
 - noTemporary : You can activate it to don't send the file in the temporary folder. The file is saved in the destination folder;
 - fileExtensions: Limit the extension name of file send;
 - sizeLimit: The max size of file in byte;
 - minSizeLimit: The min size of file in byte;

Retrieve your files
---------------------------
In the save action, you could retrieve the file. The parameter is the name of hidden input passed in inputName (above).

Move all file in your folder:
```
	$this->fileupload->moveFile();
```
If you want to change the destination folder (example: to add an id)
```
	$this->fileupload->moveFile(null, 'my_new_folder');
```

There is a function to get the list of files in temporary folder:
```
	$this->fileupload->hasFileToMove();
```

In listener afterUpload
-----------------------
Your controller (class) must implements FileUploaderOnUploadInterface. you will add 2 functions beforeUpload and afterUpload.
In afterUpload you could move your file with the function moveFileWithoutSave. The first parameter is ALWAYS $result['targetFolder'].
```
	$this->fileUpload->moveFileWithoutSave();
```

A quick note about file encoding
-----------------------
If a user tries to input non-latin character in the uploaded file name, the file name will be URL-encoded before being
stored on the server's disk. This is because all file systems do not support the same character sets. By URL-encoding the
file name, we make sure the file name can be read on any operating system.
