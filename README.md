=============================================

This package contains an upload widget based on [jQuery File Upload](http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/). This allows easy uploading of files in your application.

The widget is a simple class implementing the [HtmlElementInterface](http://mouf-php.com/packages/mouf/html.htmlelement/README.md) interface.

We have added methods and features to integrate it in a Mouf package.
